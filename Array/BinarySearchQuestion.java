//A question given that we have to satisfy the condition with max possible value
//condition is (x^k<=n) here user give us k and n we have to return the max possible value of x
//Linaer search is good for lower value but it doesn't fit for a large number of n
//We perform Binary Search for Optimization the solution 
//It good for time complexity and memory Optimization
