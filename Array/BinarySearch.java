//for binary search we need sorted data
//Divide and Conquare , defining lower and higher index and Calulate the mid, 
//low index=0; and high index =arr.length-1;
//Mid is the main thing in Binary Search ,We compare mid with the target value 
//if it found we return the mid index
//if value grater than target we assign high point = mid-1;
//else low point = mid+1;
// if elements not found we return -1;
// we use while loop beacuse we have no idea how many iteration going on.
